\section{Physics of Hot and Dense QCD in Small Systems}

\subsection{Historic overview}
% Comments wrt initial LHC program
% Table (-> Constantin, Naghmeh)

\subsection{Open questions and their theoretical implications}

% Nature of collectivity / initial vs final state
% Are “collective effects” caused by final-state interactions in pp and pPb? → we should see jet quenching and medium-quark interactions
%   RAA, X+jet correlations
%   HF vn, Strangeness enhancement
% (Smooth?) transition from pp to pPb to PbPb
% Is there a turn on of at low Nch?
%   Subevents
%   Higher order cn (may be hopeless..)
% Make clear why pp and pPb are needed
% Integrate different modelling approaches (hydro, CGC, escape, …) 
% Shortcomings of current modelling in small systems (need to argue how run 3 and 4 can improve this)
