\subsection{Introduction}

High energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and the LHC produce a relativistic fluid composed of QCD matter, i. e. quarks and gluons. It is particularly interesting to study the macroscopic properties of this fluid because - at least conceptually - they are fully fixed by the microscopic properties of a renormalizable, fundamental quantum field theory, namely QCD. One can study here experimentally, as well as theoretically, how macroscopic material properties result from microscopic field theoretic processes. Many theoretical methods ranging from perturbative to non-perturbative techniques are being developed to understand this in detail and one can expect that the insights gained here will be valuable for many related problems in fields ranging from condensed matter theory to cosmology in the future.  

One must say that currently the field is still largely driven by experimental progress. Theoretically, the connection between microscopic QCD physics and the macroscopic properties of the quark-gluon plasma are being understood step by step but a satisfactory understanding is still missing. 

Many different fronts of research are being explored at the moment. This ranges from conceptual questions on how to consistently formulate relativistic fluid dynamics or how to solve quantum field theory in non-equilibrium situations to very concrete practical questions about the thermodynamic and transport properties (such as viscosities or conductivities) of the quark-gluon plasma. Besides the role of strong interactions, also electromagnetic interactions and in particular the role of magnetic fields and the production of photons and dileptons is being explored. Other fronts of research concern the role of quantum anomalies, chirality and vorticity or the dependence of collective behavior on system size (nucleus-nucleus versus proton-nucleus and proton-proton collisions), on centrality and collision energy, the initial state directly after the collision, or various types of fluctuations. We will discuss these issues in more detail in the following subsections.
