Recently, it has been recognized that very strong electric and magnetic fields are created at early times of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In Fig.~\ref{fig:v1} (left), the time dependence of the magnetic ($\rm B_{y}$) and electric ($\rm E_{x}$) fields in \PbPb collisions at $\sqrtsNN=$ 2.76$\UTeV$ with impact parameter b=9.5$\Ufm$ is presented for a system with electric
conductivity $\rm \sigma_{el}=$0.023$\Ufm^{-1}$. The space-time evolution is obtained as solution of the Maxwell's equations as developed in \cite{Gursoy:2014aka}. The magnetic field produced in non-central heavy ion collisions is dominated by the $\rm B_{y}$ component which induces a current in the $xz$ plane while the time dependence of $\rm B_{y}$ generates an electric field which is directed in the $x$ direction. The combined effect of both fields is a current in the $xz$ plane.

The presence of early magnetic fields produced in heavy-ion collisions is expected to have an effect on the charm directed flow~\cite{Das:2016cwd,Chatterjee:2018lsx,Plumari,Sandeep}, resulting in a $\vone$ value larger than that of lighter particles (short charm formation time and therefore sensitive to the maximum magnetic field strength), and opposite for particles with charm and anti-charm (due to the Lorentz force). Also the initial vorticity of non-central collision is expected to affect the directed flow observable.
The STAR collaboration recently presented the first measurements of the directed flow $\vone$ coefficient for mesons~\cite{Singha}. This first observation of non-zero $\vone$ for charm mesons, larger than that of lighter particles, is in qualitative agreement with theoretical models including both electromagnetic and vorticity effects. The uncertainties on the difference between the $\vone$ of $\PDz$ and $\APDzero$
from STAR are still too large to draw conclusions on the effects of the early magnetic fields.
The LHC Run 3 and 4 will enable more precise measurements on the charm directed flow, which will give additional insights into the initial vorticity of the Quark Gluon Plasma and the strength of the electromagnetic fields. Figure~\ref{fig:v1} (right) shows the precision level for the difference of directed flow $\vone$ for $\PDz$ and $\APDzero$ which ALICE can measure as a function of pseudorapidity in semi-central \PbPb collisions at $\sqrtsNN=$ 5.5 $\UTeV$.
