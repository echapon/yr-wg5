\section{Summary of luminosity requirements and proposed run schedule}
\label{sec:schedule}

The physics programme presented in this report requires data-taking campaigns with various colliding systems with centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities are outlined in the following. In some cases the requirements are {\it updated} or {\it new} with respect to the present baseline LHC programme (see Section~\ref{sec:LHCpresentbaseline} and Ref.~\cite{Abelevetal:2014cna}). The main variations are a much larger $L_{\rm int}$ target for p--Pb collisions, motivated by precise studies of both initial and final state effects, a large sample of high-multiplicity pp collisions at top LHC energy to
