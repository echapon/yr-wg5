\section{Summary of luminosity requirements and proposed run schedule}
\label{sec:schedule}

The physics programme presented in this report requires data-taking campaigns with various colliding systems with centre-of-mass energies and integrated luminosities $L_{\rm int}$ are outlined in the following. In some cases the requirements are {\it updated} or {\it new} with respect to the present baseline LHC programme (see Section~\ref{sec:LHCpresentbaseline} and Ref.~\cite{Abelevetal:2014cna}). The main variations are a much larger $L_{\rm int}$ target for p--Pb collisions, motivated by high-precision studies of both initial and final state effects, a large sample of pp collisions at top LHC energy to reach the highest possible multiplicities with the smallest hadronic colliding system, and moderate samples of O--O and p--O collisions, to study the onset of hot-medium effects and to tune cosmic-ray particle production models, respectively. Finally, as discussed in the previous section, extended LHC running with intermediate-mass colliding nuclei (as for example, Ar--Ar), offers the unique opportunity of a large increase in nucleon--nucleon luminosity to access novel probes of the QGP and to open a precision era for probes which are still rare with the Pb--Pb system.
