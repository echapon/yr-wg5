%<Notes>
% Dear contacts,

% Several chapters have started defining custom commands, and this lead to some compilation issues.

% I have now prepared a file commands.tex which is in the main folder. 
% This file is included when you compile the full report (report.tex), but also when you compile the separate sections.

% Please add your custom commands to this file. When you do that, please
% - check that a command does not already exist and can be used,
% - add a comment above your commands, e.g. "% heavy flavour"

% NB. pT is \pT (already predefined in a CERN report style file). Please replace in case you are using \pt

% Best regards,
% Jan Fiete
