The recent coincident observations of gamma rays and neutrinos from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 confirmed that active galactic nuclei produce high-energy cosmic rays~\cite{IceCube:2018dnn}. This long awaited finding demonstrates that sources of cosmic rays are linked to the most violent places in our universe. Measurements of cosmic rays contribute to the understanding of the high-energy universe. Since cosmic rays are charged and bent by magnetic fields in space onto chaotic paths, their arrival directions are highly isotropic, but their mass composition contains a unique imprint of the source physics.

Cosmic rays are nuclei from proton to iron (heavier elements are negligible). The energy-dependent mass composition of cosmic rays is characteristic for different source scenarios, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, left-hand-side, which displays predictions (lines and markers) of the mean-logarithmic-mass $\mlna$ of cosmic rays. Above particle energies of $10^{15}$\,\si{eV}, $\mlna$ can only be indirectly inferred from extensive air showers, huge secondary particle cascades produced by collisions between cosmic ray and nuclei in the atmosphere. The two leading observables to infer $\mlna$ are the depth $\xmax$ of the shower maximum in the atmosphere (yellow band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}), and the number $\nmu$ of muons produced in the shower (green band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}). The width of those bands has two main contributions: the experimental uncertainties, and the model uncertainties inherent in converting the air shower observables into $\mlna$.

Leading experiments achieve an instrumental accuracy of 10\,\% of the proton-iron difference, which would strongly discriminate between source scenarios, but air shower simulations are required to convert $\nmu$ and $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ and this adds a large model uncertainty. The simulations use the multi-purpose heavy-ion event generator EPOS-LHC~\cite{Werner:2005jf}, or specialized hadronic interaction models such as \mbox{QGSJet-II.04}~\cite{Ostapchenko:2010vb} and SIBYLL-2.3c~\cite{Riehn:2017mfm}. All are designed to describe nucleus-nucleus and soft-QCD interactions by extrapolating combinations of Regge field theory tuned to available data and perturbative QCD. Uncertainties in these models arise from a lack of data on multiparticle production in the very forward phase-space in hadron-nucleus interactions at the TeV scale.

Predictions for $\xmax$ have recently converged thanks to LHC data, but need to be further improved. High-precision measurements of the inelastic cross-section (see e.g.~\cite{Aaij:2018okq} and references therein) had a large impact. Predictions for $\nmu$ vary very much and are not consistent with $\xmax$. There is overwhelming evidence from air shower experiments~\cite{Dembinski:2018UHECR,Aab:2014pza,Dembinski:2017zkb,Kokoulin:2009zz,Abbasi:2018fkz} that the muon number $\nmu$ is underestimated in simulations starting from $10^{17}$\,eV, corresponding to 14\,TeV cms energy accessible by the LHC. Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side, is a representative data point from the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is well above EPOS-LHC predictions. EPOS-LHC and SIBYLL-2.3c produce most muons of all models.
% The muon discrepancy casts a shadow on the general confidence in air shower simulations.

% The impact can be see in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_ray_related_lhc_measurements}, left-hand-side, which compares up-to-date models (solid lines) tuned to LHC data to predictions from older models (dashed and dotted lines).

% why we want to discuss ``forward'' in the context of ``pO''???
%The forward direction is in particular important for the air shower development, and naturally difficult to %instrument at accelerators. This results in relatively large model uncertainties due to missing constraints %by data in the relevant phase space.

Two aspects of multi-particle production with a strong effect on $\nmu$ have been identified\cite{Ulrich:2010rg}, the hadron multiplicity $\nmult$ and the energy fraction $\alpha$ that goes into neutral pions. The impact of changing these variables in EPOS-LHC at $13$\,TeV cms energy and extrapolating upward in energy is also shown in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side. A combined measurement to 5\,\% accuracy of both variables at the LHC would reduce the model uncertainty for the conversion of $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ well below the experimental uncertainty of 10\,\%, and has the clear potential to resolve the discrepancy in the muon number $N_\mu$.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Comparison of charged particle multiplicity measurements at different center-of-mass energies and in different colliding systems with the EPOS-LHC model~\cite{Kim:2018ink}.}
\label{fig:multiplicity_tuning}
\end{figure}

Forward-produced hadrons dominate air shower development and experience significant nuclear modification\cite{Aaij:2017cqq,Acharya:2018qsh}. Proton-proton collisions alone cannot constrain $\alpha$ and $\nmult$ to 5\,\% for p-air collisions~\cite{dEnterria:2018kcz}. To achieve the desired accuracy and avoid systematic uncertainties, a direct measurement of multi-particle production of light hadrons in p-O collisions is highly desirable. The measurement cannot be replaced by an interpolation of p-p and p-Pb data, since dominant nuclear effects are expected to be different for light and heavy collision partners. Light nuclei are described by the shell model and nucleon correlations are important. Lead nuclei can be described by a simpler model, essentially a Wood-Saxon potential with reduced correlations that cannot be probed well in experiments.
% Furthermore the collective effects which were not expected to be observed in light system (and as a consequence not implemented in specialized models for air shower simulation) seems to be very present in p-Pb~\cite{ALICE:2017jyt}.
The difficulty of predicting nuclear effects is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplicity_tuning}. EPOS-LHC predictions for Xe-Xe collisions significantly underestimate the observed yields in the central region, despite a satisfactory description of p-p, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions. The deviations in Xe-Xe are much larger than what is expected from a simple interpolation~\cite{Kim:2018ink}. Isolating peripheral p-Pb collisions to mimic p-air collisions with the same number of binary collisions is also not a solution. Centrality in p-Pb collisions is extracted from the data using various centrality estimators in a model-dependent way. The associated uncertainty would translate into an uncertainty on the hadron spectra much larger than the target of 5\,\%~\cite{Toia:2014wia}. However, p-O measurements would provide a sensitive test of the model-dependence of centrality estimators since the thickness of the oxygen nucleus and hence the average number of wounded nucleons is about a factor of two smaller.

 The luminosity requirements to reach the physics goals are moderate. A statistical accuracy of 5\,\% can be achieved with a few 100\,M minimum-bias events, which can be accumulated within a day of data-taking as described in Section~\ref{sec:pOrun}. The setup of p-O collisions would follow the successful rapid set-up procedure previously used in the 2012 p-Pb run and the 2017 Xe-Xe run.



% This explicitly is not limited to just  the center-of-mass energy, but is very critical also for the ``forward'' phase space, and in particular for nuclear effects. The quality of the extrapolation can only be checked and improved with dedicated measurements. For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplicity_sqrt} the extraplation of central charged particle multiplicty is illustrated. The models EPOS-1.99, QGSJet01 and SIBYLL2.1 were all tuned up to Tevatron energies ($\sqrt{s}=900$\,GeV), and indicated good agreement with LHC data at $\sqrt{s}=2.36\,$TeV but performed very poorly on $\sqrt{s}=7\,$TeV LHC data. However, the LHC-tuned models EPOS-1.99, QGSJetII and SIBYLL2.3 do now a very good prediction at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, but start to diverge beyond that. It seems we can make reasonable model extrapolation of about a factor of two in energy.

The physics opportunities offered by a fixed-target programme at the LHC have been developped in several publications of the AFTER@LHC study group \cite{Brodsky:2012vg, Lansberg:Adv2015} and can be summarised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item advance our understanding of the large-$x$ gluon, sea quark and heavy-quark content in the nucleon and nucleus;
\item advance our understanding of the dynamics and spin of gluons inside polarised nucleons (if a polarised target were used);
\item advance our understanding of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions between the SPS and the largest RHIC centre-of-mass energies.
\end{itemize}
The LHCb Collaboration has already started a fixed-target physics programme using both proton~\cite{Aaij:2018svt,Aaij:2018ogq} and Pb beams colliding with noble-gas nuclei at rest injected with the SMOG system~\cite{SMOG}: the future plans for the LHCb fixed-target programme are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:FTLHCb}. Studies are ongoing within the ALICE Collaboration to explore the complementary physics potential with the ALICE detector and the implementation options (Section~\ref{sec:FTALICE}). 

\subsubsection{Status and future plans in LHCb}
\label{sec:FTLHCb}

\textcolor{blue}{A short summary of the LHCb material input to the Physics beyond Collider working group will be provided by Giacomo Graziani}

\subsubsection{Opportunities with ALICE}
\label{sec:FTALICE}


One of the main strengths of ALICE in fixed target mode would be its large rapidity coverage. Assuming a target location at $z=0$, the ALICE muon spectrometer (and future Muon Forward Tracker) would access the mid- to backward rapidity in the centre-of-mass frame ($-2.3 < y_{\rm cms} < -0.8$)\footnote{\label{note1} considering an incident proton beam on the target. For an incident lead beam, the muon spectrometer rapidity coverage is $-1.8 < y_{\rm cms} < -0.3$ and central barrel coverage $-5.2 < y_{\rm cms} < -3.4$}. In addition, the long absorber in front of the muon tracking station is an asset for background rejection and Drell-Yan studies at low energy. The ALICE central barrel offers a complementary coverage to the muon arm by accessing the very backward rapidity region ($-5.7  < y_{\rm cms} < -3.9$), reaching the end of phase space for several probes. Thanks to its excellent particle identification capabilities, particle detection and identification down to low $p_{\rm T}$, unique measurement of soft probes and open heavy flavours can be pursued. Another asset of the ALICE apparatus is the capability to operate with good performances in a high particle density environment. Access to most central AA collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$~=~72~GeV should be possible if the interaction rate remains low. In addition, the ALICE Collaboration could potentially devote a significant data taking time to a fixed-target programme (especially with the proton beam), allowing the collection of large integrated luminosities and the investigation of several target species. Two main solutions are being investigated to deliver fixed target collisions to ALICE: an internal gaseous target or an internal solid target (coupled to a bent crystal to deflect the beam halo). On the one hand, a gas-jet or a storage cell (with levelled gas pressure) would allow to deliver about 45 pb$^{-1}$ of proton-polarised hydrogen collisions to ALICE per year (260 pb$^{-1}$  in case of proton-unpolarised H$_{2}$ collisions), and 8 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb-Xe collisions. With such system the target can be polarised, but requires large space to be installed (most likely outside the ALICE barrel magnet), requiring thus the need of additional detectors for vertexing and additional studies of the tracking performances of the TPC in such conditions. A simple unpolarised storage cell might potentially be used closer to the current ALICE IP. On the other hand, the usage of an internal solid target coupled to a bent crystal has the advantage of more portability, allowing one to install the target closer to the nominal ALICE IP and thus benefiting of the optimal performances of the current ALICE apparatus. With such a device 37 pb$^{-1}$ (6 pb$^{-1}$) of p-C (p-W) collisions, and 5 nb$^{-1}$ (3 nb$^{-1}$) of Pb-C (Pb-W) collisions could be registered in ALICE per year. The performances for several key probes have been investigated in simulations and some physics perspectives are highlighted below. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Quarkonia : Very large yields are expected for charmonia ($\sim 10^{6}$) in the ALICE muon spectrometer both in pp and Pb-Xe collisions considering one LHC year of data taking. The $\Upsilon$(1S) will also be within reach. Looking at quarkonium suppression as a function of rapidity and the system size would allow one to search for the QGP phase transition, and provide a measurement of the medium temperature for centre-of-mass energies between the ones probed at RHIC and the SPS. In pA collisons, $\Upsilon$(1S) could be used to probe large $x$ in the target, in order to constrain gluon anti-shadowing and EMC effect.}
\item{Drell-Yan : A precise measurement of the Drell-Yan process with the muon spectrometer can probe initial state effects on quarks from pA to AA collisions. The correlated background from $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ pairs in the dimuon decay channel is largely reduced at the lower center-of-mass energy of the fixed target mode, with respect to the TeV energy range.}
\item{Open Heavy Flavours : At $y_{\rm lab} \sim$ 1 about 500 (100) D$^{0}$ are expected to be produced per 0.1 rapidity unit per year in pp (Pb-W) collisions, respectively. The ALICE central barrel is probing the end of the D meson phase space, at very large-$x$, where the contribution of the intrinsic charm component in the proton could largely increase the D meson yield. Hence the ALICE central barrel is well suited to study the large-$x$ intrinsic charm component in the proton.}
\item{Identified charged particles : In few hours of Pb-Pb data taking, it would be already possible to collect 10$^{6}$ minimum bias events with the ALICE central barrel and reach an absolute statistical uncertainty of 0.01 on the elliptic flow coefficient $v_{2}$ for pions and protons, 0.02 for kaons, and 0.05 for antiprotons in semi-central events. Particle yields and flow coefficients measured at large rapidities are powerful tools to access the medium shear viscosity and temperature. High precision complementary studies to the ones performed at RHIC would clarify the collectivity picture between SPS and LHC results. In addition, measurement of identified particles up to very large rapidities would complement the limiting fragmentation studies carried out by the BRAHMS and PHOBOS experiments at RHIC.} 
\item{Strangeness : Thanks to the large yields ($\sim$10$^{8}$ per 0.1 rapidity unit per year) of $\Lambda$ expected to be produced in the ALICE central barrel in proton-polarised proton collisions, a precise measurement of the longitudinal spin transfer D$_{LL}$ of the $\Lambda$ hyperon could be carried out. This would allow one to constrain the spin-dependent strange quark (antiquark) densities at large negative $x_{F}$.}
\end{itemize}

Studies are ongoing on other key observables, such as antiproton measurements in the central barrel as a key input for cosmic ray physics, photoproduced J/$\psi$ single transverse spin asymmetry measurements in the muon spectrometer to constrain the gluon GPDs and the search for the photoproduction of hidden charm pentaquark states in the central barrel.
