The recent coincident observations of gamma rays and neutrinos from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 confirmed that active galactic nuclei produce high-energy cosmic rays~\cite{IceCube:2018dnn}. This long awaited finding demonstrates that sources of cosmic rays are linked to the most violent places in our universe. Measurements of cosmic rays contribute to the understanding of the high-energy universe. Since cosmic rays are charged and bent by magnetic fields in space onto chaotic paths, their arrival directions are highly isotropic, but their mass composition contains a unique imprint of the source physics. Precision measurements of minimum-bias events in proton-oxygen collisions have the unique power to resolve current ambiguities in the mass composition.

Cosmic rays are nuclei from protons to iron (heavier elements are negligible). The energy-dependent mass composition of cosmic rays is characteristic for different source scenarios, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, left-hand-side, which displays predictions (lines and markers) of the mean-logarithmic-mass $\mlna$ of cosmic rays. Above particle energies of $10^{15}$\,\si{eV}, $\mlna$ can only be indirectly inferred from extensive air showers, huge secondary particle cascades produced by collisions between cosmic rays and nuclei in the atmosphere. The two leading observables to infer $\mlna$ are the depth $\xmax$ of the shower maximum in the atmosphere (yellow band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}), and the number $\nmu$ of muons produced in the shower (green band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}). The width of those bands has two main contributions: the experimental uncertainties, and the model uncertainties inherent in converting the air shower observables into $\mlna$.

Leading experiments achieve an instrumental accuracy of 10\,\% of the proton-iron difference, which would strongly discriminate between source scenarios, but air shower simulations are required to convert $\nmu$ and $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ and this adds a large model uncertainty. The simulations use the multi-purpose heavy-ion event generator EPOS-LHC~\cite{Werner:2005jf}, or specialized hadronic interaction models such as \mbox{QGSJet-II.04}~\cite{Ostapchenko:2010vb} and SIBYLL-2.3c~\cite{Riehn:2017mfm}. All are designed to describe nucleus-nucleus and soft-QCD interactions by extrapolating combinations of Regge field theory tuned to available data and perturbative QCD. Uncertainties in these models arise from a lack of data on multiparticle production in the very forward phase-space in hadron-nucleus interactions at the TeV scale.

LHC measurements have already reduced the spread of model predictions for $\xmax$ in the latest generation of models. High-precision measurements of the inelastic cross-section (see e.g.~\cite{Aaij:2018okq} and references therein) had a large impact. Further measurements now have the potential to make the spread negligible. The model spread for $\nmu$ is still large and predictions are not consistent with $\xmax$ for cosmic rays with the same mass. There is overwhelming evidence from air shower experiments~\cite{Dembinski:2018UHECR,Aab:2014pza,Dembinski:2017zkb,Kokoulin:2009zz,Abbasi:2018fkz} that the muon number $\nmu$ is underestimated in simulations starting from $10^{17}$\,eV, corresponding to 14\,TeV cms energy accessible by the LHC. Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side, is a representative data point from the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is well above EPOS-LHC predictions. EPOS-LHC and SIBYLL-2.3c produce most muons of all models. This is called the \emph{Muon Puzzle}.
% The muon discrepancy casts a shadow on the general confidence in air shower simulations.

% The impact can be see in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_ray_related_lhc_measurements}, left-hand-side, which compares up-to-date models (solid lines) tuned to LHC data to predictions from older models (dashed and dotted lines).

% why we want to discuss ``forward'' in the context of ``pO''???
%The forward direction is in particular important for the air shower development, and naturally difficult to %instrument at accelerators. This results in relatively large model uncertainties due to missing constraints %by data in the relevant phase space.

Two aspects of multi-particle production with a strong effect on $\nmu$ have been identified\cite{Ulrich:2010rg}, the hadron multiplicity $\nmult$ and the energy fraction $\alpha$ that goes into neutral pions. The impact of changing these variables in EPOS-LHC at $13$\,TeV cms energy and extrapolating upward in energy is also shown in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side. A combined measurement to 5\,\% accuracy of both variables at the LHC would reduce the model uncertainty for the conversion of $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ well below the experimental uncertainty of 10\,\%, and has the clear potential to resolve the discrepancy in the muon number $N_\mu$. To reach the accuracy goal, the following measurements are desired:
\begin{itemize}
\item Double-differential production cross-section for charged pions, kaons, and protons: \\ ALICE $|\eta| < 0.9$, LHCb $2 < \eta < 5$
\item Production cross-section for neutral pions and neutrons: LHCf $8.4 < \eta$.
\item Energy flow over pseudo-rapidity, separated for hadrons and gammas:\\ CMS+CASTOR $-6.6 < \eta < 5.2$, ATLAS $-4.5 < \eta < 4.5$.
\end{itemize}
Energy flow measurements separated by hadronic and electromagnetic energy deposit constrain both $\nmult$ and $\alpha$, and can be done further forward than direct measurements of charged tracks.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\main/beyond/fig/multiplicity_tuning_mod.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of charged particle multiplicity measurements at different center-of-mass energies and in different colliding systems with the EPOS-LHC model~\cite{Kim:2018ink}. Both plots show $\text{d} N/\text{d}\eta$.}
\label{fig:multiplicity_tuning}
\end{figure}

The impact projections assume that $\nmult$ and $\alpha$ are measured in proton-oxygen collisions at the LHC, which directly mimic interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. Constraining $\alpha$ and $\nmult$ to 5\,\% with existing \pp and \pPb data is very challenging~\cite{dEnterria:2018kcz}, since forward-produced hadrons experience strong nuclear modification\cite{Aaij:2017cqq,Acharya:2018qsh,Adriani:2015iwv}. A sufficiently accurate theory to predict nuclear modification in the \pO system based on \pp and \pPb data is not yet available, and a simple interpolation is not realiable since both systems are far away in $\ln A$.
% Furthermore the collective effects which were not expected to be observed in light system (and as a consequence not implemented in specialized models for air shower simulation) seems to be very present in p-Pb~\cite{ALICE:2017jyt}.
The difficulty of predicting hadron production in ion collisions is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplicity_tuning}. EPOS-LHC predictions for \XeXe collisions significantly underestimate the observed yields in the central region, despite a satisfactory description of \pp, \pPb, and \PbPb collisions. The deviations in \XeXe are much larger than what is expected from a simple interpolation~\cite{Kim:2018ink}. The dominant nuclear effects are expected to be different for light and heavy collision partners. Light nuclei are described by the shell model and nucleon correlations are important. Lead nuclei can be described by a simpler model, essentially a Wood-Saxon potential with reduced nucleon correlations that cannot be probed well in experiments.

Selecting peripheral \pPb collisions to mimic p-air collisions with the same number of binary collisions was considered as an alternative to direct \pO measurements, but it is not viable. Centrality in \pPb collisions is extracted from the data using various centrality estimators with different selection biases. These biases would increase the uncertainty of the proposed measurements well beyond the target of 5\,\%~\cite{Adam:2014qja}. However, \pO measurements could provide a sensitive test of centrality estimators since the thickness of the oxygen nucleus and hence the average number of wounded nucleons is about a factor of two smaller. The advantages of estimating centrality in a small ion system are discussed in Sect.~\ref{sect:smallsystems_OO}.

The luminosity requirements to reach the physics goals are moderate. A statistical accuracy better than 5\,\% can be achieved with a few 100\,M minimum-bias events, which can be accumulated within a day of data-taking. Luminosity calculations for light ion systems are given in Sect.\ \ref{sec:lightions}. The setup of \pO collisions would follow the successful rapid set-up procedure previously used in the 2012 \pPb run and the 2017 \XeXe run, as described in Sect.~\ref{sec:pOrun}.

% This explicitly is not limited to just  the center-of-mass energy, but is very critical also for the ``forward'' phase space, and in particular for nuclear effects. The quality of the extrapolation can only be checked and improved with dedicated measurements. For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplicity_sqrt} the extraplation of central charged particle multiplicty is illustrated. The models EPOS-1.99, QGSJet01 and SIBYLL2.1 were all tuned up to Tevatron energies ($\sqrt{s}=900$\,GeV), and indicated good agreement with LHC data at $\sqrt{s}=2.36\,$TeV but performed very poorly on $\sqrt{s}=7\,$TeV LHC data. However, the LHC-tuned models EPOS-1.99, QGSJetII and SIBYLL2.3 do now a very good prediction at $\sqrt{s}=13$\,TeV, but start to diverge beyond that. It seems we can make reasonable model extrapolation of about a factor of two in energy.

{\bf For the ackn: RFBR/CNRS grant 18-52-15007}

The physics opportunities offered by a fixed-target programme at the LHC have been developped in several publications of the AFTER@LHC study group \cite{Brodsky:2012vg, Lansberg:Adv2015} and can be summarised as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item advance our understanding of the large-$x$ gluon, sea quark and heavy-quark content in the nucleon and nucleus;
\item advance our understanding of the dynamics and spin of gluons inside polarised nucleons (if a polarised target were used);
\item advance our understanding of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions between the SPS and the largest RHIC centre-of-mass energies.
\end{itemize}
The LHCb Collaboration has already started a fixed-target physics programme using both proton~\cite{Aaij:2018svt,Aaij:2018ogq} and Pb beams colliding with noble-gas nuclei at rest injected with the SMOG system~\cite{SMOG}: the future plans for the LHCb fixed-target programme are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:FTLHCb}. Studies are ongoing within the ALICE Collaboration to explore the complementary physics potential with the ALICE detector and the implementation options (Section~\ref{sec:FTALICE}). 

\subsubsection{Status and future plans in LHCb}
\label{sec:FTLHCb}


The LHCb experiment has pioneered fixed target physics at the LHC since Run 2, 
using noble-gas targets (helium, neon and argon) obtained by injecting the gas directly in 
the LHC vacuum pipe in the proximity of the LHCb~collision point
through the SMOG device~\cite{smog}.
The nominal target gas pressure of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ mbar corresponds,
for a typical LHC beam of $10^{14}$ protons, to a luminosity of 
$6 \times 10^{29} \text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ for collisions occurring in one
meter of gas along the beam direction, which is roughly the acceptance of the
LHCb vertex detector.

The forward geometry of the detector is particularly well suited for
this configuration.  It provides three units
of pseudorapidity corresponding to mid and backward rapidities ($-2.8 < y_{cms}< 0.2$
for a beam energy of 6.5 TeV), fully equipped with tracking and particle identification. 
Proton-nucleus and Pb-nucleus collisions using fixed targets of different
nuclear size can be studied at the energy scale of $\sqrtsnn \sim 100$
GeV with unique coverage of the high-$x$ regime in the target nucleon.

The samples collected during Run 2, corresponding
to integrated luminosities up to about $100~\invnb$, 
allowed to perform 
studies of particle production which are of particular relevance
to cosmic ray physics~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-031}, and to
collect unprecedented samples of charmed hadrons in
fixed-target collisions at this energy
scale~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-023}. 
These data can provide unique inputs to
discriminate cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-flavour production
from the effect of deconfinement, and to study nuclear PDFs 
at large $x$. The physics reach of heavy-flavour studies is presently
limited by the size of these samples. Measurements of absolute
cross-sections are also limited in accuracy by the determination of the
luminosity, since the gas pressure can be controlled only
within $\pm 50\%$ with the SMOG device. For the first fixed-target physics
results, the integrated luminosity has been determined from the rate of
elastically scattered atomic electrons with a precision of
6\%~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-031}. 

An upgraded gas target device, named SMOG2, is currently being developed, and expected
to be operational already during Run 3. 
In the new setup, the gas is contained in a storage cell, consisting
of a 20-cm-long open-ended tube with a diameter of 1 cm, feeded by a capillary.
It allows to increase the gas density in the target
by at least one order of magnitude with respect to SMOG, reaching
luminosities of order $10^{31}~\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ with
proton beams.
The target is placed upstream, from -50 to -30 cm, the nominal  LHCb
collision point and is thus not overlapping the luminous pp region.
This opens the possibility to acquire fixed target events
simultaneously with collision events with negligible impact to the
pp physics program.
The new setup would also allow other gases to be injected, notably hydrogen and deuterium, providing
pp collisions in fixed-target mode as a reference for all pA
collision samples, and extending the physics case to the study
of the three-dimensional structure functions of the nucleon through
spin-independent observables~\cite{3dpdf}. Heavy noble gases as Kr
and Xe would also be usable.
The device will be equipped with a gas feed system, allowing
to know the target gas density at 1\% level.

Assuming that about 10\% of the beam intensity can be exploited for
fixed-target physics, either in synergy with $pp$ data taking or through dedicated runs,
samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of order $0.1~\textrm{fb}^{-1}$
(using proton beams) and $0.1~\textrm{pb}^{-1}$ (using Pb beams) 
can be collected per year, also profiting from the increased beam
intensity provided by the HL-LHC.

Samples of this size would allow copious production of Drell-Yan
and heavy flavour states, including $\textrm{b}\overline{\textrm{b}}$ mesons.
As an example, rough estimates are provided in
Table~\ref{tab:ftyields} for the yields of reconstructed events in an assumed sample of pAr collisions corresponding to $0.1~\textrm{fb}^{-1}$.
Substantial advancements in the understanding of parton
distributions for gluons, antiquark and heavy-quarks 
at large $x$, where PDFs are now poorly constrained, are
foreseeable~\cite{after,Hadjidakis:2018ifr}. The precise determination
of heavy hadron production at large $x$ is expected to clarify
the  extent of the intrinsic heavy quark content
in the nucleon~\cite{Brodsky:1980pb,Brodsky:2015fna}, and to constrain
modifications of the nuclear PDFs due to initial state effects
(anti-shadowing and EMC effect~\cite{Geesaman:1995yd}, saturation
effects~\cite{Albacete:2014fwa}).
Sequential quarkonia suppression is a main signature for
deconfinement~\cite{Matsui:1986dk}, but is also affected by final
state effects as break-up of the heavy quark  pair~\cite{Vogt:2001ky}
and statistical recombination~\cite{BraunMunzinger:2000px}.
The rich samples of  different quarkonia states reconstructed 
in fixed target data will allow to
investigate sequential suppression at an energy scale
between the SPS and RHIC/LHC, for 
collision systems ranging from pp to PbXe.
The study of collisions of Pb beams on heavy nuclei has been 
limited in Run 2  by the detector tracking capabilities and would
greatly profit from the higher detector granularity offered by the 
LHCb upgrade 1 and upgrade 2 detectors.

\end{table}


The fixed-target program also presents a very good testbed for the
hydrodynamic description of the QCD medium produced in heavy-ion collisions
down to the energy of $\sqrtsnn \sim 100$~GeV, thanks to the
considerable pseudorapidity coverage, with particle identification capability for pions,
kaons and protons as well as neutral particles $\phi$, $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda^0$.
Measurements of flow observables and correlations can contribute in particular to shed light on the
extension of the hydrodynamic description~\cite{Song:2007ux,Schenke:2010rr} 
successful at top RHIC energy and at the LHC towards lower beam
energies requiring an appropriate 
treatment of baryon density~\cite{Karpenko:2015xea}, and a fully 3 dimensional initial state~\cite{Shen:2017bsr}.
This can provide important inputs to the search for the critical point in
the QCD phase diagram~\cite{Stephanov:2004wx,Luo:2017faz}. 
In addition, the extension of the fluid dynamical paradigm towards smaller collision systems as an
explanation of the experimental findings in proton(deuteron)-nucleus and \pp~collisions
at the LHC~\cite{Khachatryan:2010gv,CMS:2012qk,Abelev:2012ola,Aad:2012gla,Aaij:2015qcq} and
at RHIC~\cite{Adare:2018toe} can be probed in a novel kinematic regime.


The study of ultra-peripheral collisions in the fixed target
configuration also offers a complementary kinematic regime to
the similar studies in beam-beam collisions discussed in
Section\ref{10}. 
An intriguing possibility would be the observation of $\eta_c$ photoproduction in the PbAr sample, where the cross
section is estimated to be of order $1$~nb~\cite{Goncalves:2015hra}. This would constitute 
a confirmation for the existence of the odderon, since the $\eta_c$ state can't be produced in the $\gamma$-pomeron 
process and would be under threshold for the $\gamma$-$\gamma$ process in fixed-target PbA collisions.
Large samples of exclusively produced $\rho^0$ and $\omega$ are also expected~\cite{Goncalves:2018htp}.


Studies of proton collisions on light nuclei provide crucial inputs to the
understanding of cosmic ray propagation in the interstellar medium
(using H and He targets) and in the atmosphere (using N and O
targets). The interpretation of the precise measurements of the
antiproton component in cosmic rays, performed in the last decade by the
PAMELA~\cite{Pamela} and AMS-02~\cite{AMS02} space-based missions, is
presently limited by the knowledge of the antiproton production
in the interstellar medium. The first measurement of antiproton production
in $p$He collisions has been performed by LHCb with Run 2
data~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-031} and has been used to improve the 
sensitivity to a possible dark matter contribution to the cosmic antiproton
flux~\cite{Reinert:2017aga,Korsmeier:2018gcy}. 
During Run 3, it is planned to extend these studies with a hydrogen
target. The production of antineutrons can also be inferred indirectly
by evaluating isospin violation in antiproton production 
from proton-hydrogen and proton-deuterium collisions.

A better understanding of the bulk of particle production in
high-energy hadronic collisions is also crucial to the modeling of
atmospheric showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. 
Despite the moderate energy scale, fixed target data offer the
unique possibility to use a wide range of nuclear targets, including
nitrogen and oxygen, and to study production at large $x$. 
The main background for the observation of the astrophysical
high-energy neutrino flux, recently established by 
the IceCube collaboration~\cite{Aartsen:2013jdh}, originates from
neutrinos of PeV energy produced from decays of charmed hadrons in
atmospheric showers. A relevant uncertainty on this background
is related to the possible intrisic charm contribution to the charm
PDF at large $x$~\cite{Laha:2016dri}.  
Knowledge of light hadron production, notably baryons, at large $x$ will allow 
to improve the modeling of the number of muons produced in the lateral
development of the showers, which is a key observables to infer the
mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, as discussed in Section~\ref{11.3}.


More ambitious projects for future target upgrades have also been proposed for a possible installation
in LHCb on the time scale of HL-LHC. These are beyond the baseline
LHCb Upgrade 2. A polarised gas target similar to that used in
HERMES~\cite{Airapetian:2004yf}, installed upstream of the LHCb vertex
detector, would make LHCb a key contributor to spin physics. 
With this option, LHCb would have access to single spin asymmetries in an
unique kinematic range for a variety of final states, including unique
measurements with quarkonium and Drell-Yan lepton
pairs~\cite{Kikola:2017hnp}. 
Measurements of the three-dimensional structure of nucleons from hadron collisions would be highly
complementary to the program at the electron-ion collider, which is proposed on a
comparable time scale.


\subsubsection{Opportunities with ALICE}
\label{sec:FTALICE}


One of the main strengths of ALICE in fixed target mode would be its large rapidity coverage. Assuming a target location at $z=0$, the ALICE muon spectrometer (and future Muon Forward Tracker) would access the mid- to backward rapidity in the centre-of-mass frame ($-2.3 < y_{\rm cms} < -0.8$)\footnote{\label{note1} considering an incident proton beam on the target. For an incident lead beam, the muon spectrometer rapidity coverage is $-1.8 < y_{\rm cms} < -0.3$ and central barrel coverage $-5.2 < y_{\rm cms} < -3.4$}. In addition, the long absorber in front of the muon tracking station is an asset for background rejection and Drell-Yan studies at low energy. The ALICE central barrel offers a complementary coverage to the muon arm by accessing the very backward rapidity region ($-5.7  < y_{\rm cms} < -3.9$), reaching the end of phase space for several probes. Thanks to its excellent particle identification capabilities, particle detection and identification down to low $p_{\rm T}$, unique measurement of soft probes and open heavy flavours can be pursued. Another asset of the ALICE apparatus is the capability to operate with good performances in a high particle density environment. Access to most central AA collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$~=~72~GeV should be possible if the interaction rate remains low. In addition, the ALICE Collaboration could potentially devote a significant data taking time to a fixed-target programme (especially with the proton beam), allowing the collection of large integrated luminosities and the investigation of several target species. Two main solutions are being investigated to deliver fixed target collisions to ALICE: an internal gaseous target or an internal solid target (coupled to a bent crystal to deflect the beam halo). On the one hand, a gas-jet or a storage cell (with levelled gas pressure) would allow to deliver about 45 pb$^{-1}$ of proton-polarised hydrogen collisions to ALICE per year (260 pb$^{-1}$  in case of proton-unpolarised H$_{2}$ collisions), and 8 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb-Xe collisions. With such system the target can be polarised, but requires large space to be installed (most likely outside the ALICE barrel magnet), requiring thus the need of additional detectors for vertexing and additional studies of the tracking performances of the TPC in such conditions. A simple unpolarised storage cell might potentially be used closer to the current ALICE IP. On the other hand, the usage of an internal solid target coupled to a bent crystal has the advantage of more portability, allowing one to install the target closer to the nominal ALICE IP and thus benefiting of the optimal performances of the current ALICE apparatus. With such a device 37 pb$^{-1}$ (6 pb$^{-1}$) of p-C (p-W) collisions, and 5 nb$^{-1}$ (3 nb$^{-1}$) of Pb-C (Pb-W) collisions could be registered in ALICE per year. The performances for several key probes have been investigated in simulations and some physics perspectives are highlighted below. 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Quarkonia : Very large yields are expected for charmonia ($\sim 10^{6}$) in the ALICE muon spectrometer both in pp and Pb-Xe collisions considering one LHC year of data taking. The $\Upsilon$(1S) will also be within reach. Looking at quarkonium suppression as a function of rapidity and the system size would allow one to search for the QGP phase transition, and provide a measurement of the medium temperature for centre-of-mass energies between the ones probed at RHIC and the SPS. In pA collisons, $\Upsilon$(1S) could be used to probe large $x$ in the target, in order to constrain gluon anti-shadowing and EMC effect.}
\item{Drell-Yan : A precise measurement of the Drell-Yan process with the muon spectrometer can probe initial state effects on quarks from pA to AA collisions. The correlated background from $b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ pairs in the dimuon decay channel is largely reduced at the lower center-of-mass energy of the fixed target mode, with respect to the TeV energy range.}
\item{Open Heavy Flavours : At $y_{\rm lab} \sim$ 1 about 500 (100) D$^{0}$ are expected to be produced per 0.1 rapidity unit per year in pp (Pb-W) collisions, respectively. The ALICE central barrel is probing the end of the D meson phase space, at very large-$x$, where the contribution of the intrinsic charm component in the proton could largely increase the D meson yield. Hence the ALICE central barrel is well suited to study the large-$x$ intrinsic charm component in the proton.}
\item{Identified charged particles : In few hours of Pb-Pb data taking, it would be already possible to collect 10$^{6}$ minimum bias events with the ALICE central barrel and reach an absolute statistical uncertainty of 0.01 on the elliptic flow coefficient $v_{2}$ for pions and protons, 0.02 for kaons, and 0.05 for antiprotons in semi-central events. Particle yields and flow coefficients measured at large rapidities are powerful tools to access the medium shear viscosity and temperature. High precision complementary studies to the ones performed at RHIC would clarify the collectivity picture between SPS and LHC results. In addition, measurement of identified particles up to very large rapidities would complement the limiting fragmentation studies carried out by the BRAHMS and PHOBOS experiments at RHIC.} 
\item{Strangeness : Thanks to the large yields ($\sim$10$^{8}$ per 0.1 rapidity unit per year) of $\Lambda$ expected to be produced in the ALICE central barrel in proton-polarised proton collisions, a precise measurement of the longitudinal spin transfer D$_{LL}$ of the $\Lambda$ hyperon could be carried out. This would allow one to constrain the spin-dependent strange quark (antiquark) densities at large negative $x_{F}$.}
\end{itemize}

Studies are ongoing on other key observables, such as antiproton measurements in the central barrel as a key input for cosmic ray physics, photoproduced J/$\psi$ single transverse spin asymmetry measurements in the muon spectrometer to constrain the gluon GPDs and the search for the photoproduction of hidden charm pentaquark states in the central barrel.
