The recent coincident observations of gamma rays and neutrinos from the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 confirmed that active galactic nuclei produce high-energy cosmic rays~\cite{IceCube:2018dnn}. This is a long awaited finding demonstrates that sources of cosmic rays are linked to the most violent places in our universe. Measurements of cosmic rays contribute to the understanding of the high-energy universe. Since cosmic rays are charged and bent onto chaotic paths by magnetic fields in space, their arrival directions are highly isotropic, but their mass composition contains a unique imprint from the source physics.

Cosmic rays are nuclei from proton to iron, with a negligible fraction of heavier elements. The mass composition of cosmic rays in a given energy interval is characteristic for different source scenarios. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, left-hand-side, where the mean-logarithmic-mass $\mlna$ of cosmic rays is shown for several source scenarios (lines and markers). The model predictions are compared to a compilation of experimental data. Above $10^{15}$\,\si{eV}, $\mlna$ can only be indirectly inferred from extensive air showers, huge secondary particle cascades produced by collisions between cosmic ray and nuclei in the atmosphere. The two leading observables to infer $\mlna$ are the depth $\xmax$ of the shower maximum in the atmosphere (yellow band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}), and the number $\nmu$ of muons produced in the shower (green band in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}). The width of those bands has two main contributions: the experimental uncertainties, and the model uncertainties inherent in converting the air shower observables into $\mlna$.

Leading experiments achieve an experimental uncertainty of 10 to 15\% in $\mlna$ from $\xmax$ and $\nmu$, which would be sufficient to discriminate between source scenarios, but air shower simulations are required to convert $\nmu$ and $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ and this adds a large model uncertainty. The simulations use the general-purpose heavy-ion event generator EPOS-LHC~\cite{Werner:2005jf}, or more specialized hadronic interaction models such as \mbox{QGSJet-II.04}~\cite{Ostapchenko:2010vb} and SIBYLL-2.3c~\cite{Riehn:2017mfm}, which are designed to describe nucleus-nucleus and soft-QCD interactions by extrapolating using a combination of Regge field theory and perturbative QCD tuned to available data.
The uncertainties arise from a lack of data on multiparticle production in the very forward phase-space in hadron-nucleus interactions at very high energies.

Predictions for the observable $\xmax$ have converged recently thanks to LHC measurements, in particular due to high-precision measurements of the inelastic cross-section (see e.g.~\cite{Aaij:2018okq} and references therein). The predictions for $\nmu$ still vary significantly and are not consistent with $\xmax$. There is overwhelming evidence from air shower experiments~\cite{Aab:2014pza,Dembinski:2017zkb,Kokoulin:2009zz,AbuZayyad:1999xa,Aab:2014dua} that the muon number $\nmu$ is underestimated in simulations at high energies, as indicated by the data point from the Pierre Auger Observatory in Fig.~\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side, which is well above the predictions from all current hadronic interaction models. This produces conflicting interpretation of the cosmic ray composition and impairs the general confidence in air shower simulations.

% The impact can be see in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_ray_related_lhc_measurements}, left-hand-side, which compares up-to-date models (solid lines) tuned to LHC data to predictions from older models (dashed and dotted lines).

% why we want to discuss ``forward'' in the context of ``pO''???
%The forward direction is in particular important for the air shower development, and naturally difficult to %instrument at accelerators. This results in relatively large model uncertainties due to missing constraints %by data in the relevant phase space. 

Two aspects of multi-particle production with a strong effect on $\nmu$ have been identified, the hadron multiplicity $\nmult$ and the energy fraction $\alpha$ that goes into neutral pions. The impact of changing these variables in EPOS-LHC at $13$\,TeV cms energy and extrapolating is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:cosmic_rays}, right-hand-side. A measurement to 5\,\% accuracy of both variables at the LHC would reduce the model uncertainty for the conversion of $\xmax$ to $\mlna$ below the experimental uncertainty, and has the clear potential to resolve the discrepancy in the muon number.

Hadrons produced in the forward direction dominate the air shower development and experience significant nuclear modification\cite{Aaij:2017cqq}. The atmosphere consists of nitrogen and oxygen, therefore p-p collisions alone cannot constrain $\alpha$ and $\nmult$ to 5\,\%~\cite{dEnterria:2018kcz}. How to interpolate from p-p and p-Pb data to p-N or p-O is not clear, because the dominant nuclear effects for a light and heavy collision partner are expected to be different. Light nuclei are described by the shell model and nucleon correlations are important. Lead nuclei can be described by a simpler model, essentially a Wood-Saxon potential. The effect of correlations is reduced and cannot be probed well in experiments.
% Furthermore the collective effects which were not expected to be observed in light system (and as a consequence not implemented in specialized models for air shower simulation) seems to be very present in p-Pb~\cite{ALICE:2017jyt}.
The difficulty of predicting nuclear effects is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:multiplicity_tuning}, which shows EPOS-LHC predictions for Xe-Xe collisions, which deviate from the measurement, although EPOS-LHC provides a good description of p-p, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb data. The deviations in Xe-Xe are much larger than what is expected from a simple interpolation~\cite{Kim:2018ink}. Isolating peripheral p-Pb collisions to mimic p-O collisions with the same number of binary collisions is not a viable solution either, since this number is experimentally not well determined~\cite{Toia:2014wia}.

To achieve the desired accuracy and avoid systematic uncertainties, a direct measurement of multi-particle production of light hadrons in proton-oxygen collisions is highly desirable. The luminosity requirements to reach the physics goals are moderate. To reach a statistical accuracy of 5\,\%, 100\,M minimum-bias events are needed, which can be accumulated within a day of data-taking as described in Section~\ref{sec:pOrun}. The setup of p-O collisions would follow the successful rapid set-up procedure previously used in the 2012 p-Pb run and the 2017 Xe-Xe run.
